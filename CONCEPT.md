# Motion Canvas — Concept & Direction

## Theme: Constellation

Nodes, connections, emergence, structure.

---

## 1. Core Concept

Motion Canvas is an interactive constellation where cursor movement creates and connects nodes, forming temporary networks that reveal hidden connections and dissolve when you look away—demonstrating that structure emerges from interaction, not decoration.

## 2. 30-Second Experience Arc

**0–5s (First Impression)**
A sparse field of subtle nodes appears, barely visible. They pulse gently, suggesting life. No text, no instructions—just presence.

**5–15s (First Interaction Discovery)**
As the cursor moves, nodes within proximity connect with thin lines, forming a constellation. The network grows with movement. A subtle realization: "I'm drawing with my cursor."

**15–30s (Subtle "Wow" Moment)**
The constellation reaches a threshold—nodes that were once separate now form a cohesive pattern. When the cursor pauses, the network holds for a moment, then gracefully dissolves, leaving only the original nodes. The cycle is complete: creation, connection, release.

## 3. Interaction Principle

**Proximity Creates Connection, Distance Creates Release**

Nodes connect when the cursor (or another node) enters their influence radius. Connections strengthen with proximity and time. When the cursor moves away, connections fade based on distance and time since last interaction. This creates a system that feels responsive and alive, but never random—every connection has a clear cause.

## 4. Visual Language

**Shapes:**
- Nodes: Small circles (2–4px), subtle fill with soft glow
- Connections: Thin lines (0.5–1px), opacity varies by strength
- Fields: No background shapes—nodes exist in negative space

**Motion Style:**
- Calm and drifting—nodes float slowly, connections form with gentle easing
- Elastic when connections snap into place (subtle spring)
- Sharp only when cursor enters/leaves a node's radius (micro-interaction)

**Constraints:**
- Minimal UI: No navigation, no buttons, no text (except perhaps a single word on first load)
- Restrained palette: Monochrome base (dark background, light nodes) with one accent color for active connections
- No clutter: Maximum 20–30 nodes visible at once; connections fade before they accumulate

## 5. Audience

1. **Creative Directors at Agencies/Studios** — Need proof that interactive experiences can be elegant and purposeful, not just flashy demos.

2. **Founders Building Brand Experiences** — Want to see how technical craft can create emotional connection without overwhelming the user.

## 6. Signature Mechanic

**"When I move my cursor, nodes connect into constellations that dissolve when I stop."**

This single sentence captures the entire interaction model. It's immediately understandable, shareable, and demonstrates both creative vision and technical execution in one gesture.

**Design Philosophy:** The experience explains itself. No instructions needed. Every interaction is intentional. Every motion serves the core mechanic. Restraint creates impact.
